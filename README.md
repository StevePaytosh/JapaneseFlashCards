# Japanese Flash Cards
**ABOUT**

The Japanese Flash Card App generates flash card questions based on either hard-coded inputs or by taking in a Pipe Separated Values (PSV) file.

* Questions may come in the form of Kanji, Katakana, Hiragana, Romanji or a mix of these depending on the category and how the questions are written
* Questions will typically indicate a category to help give context to the question being asked
* The next button can be used to reveal the answer to a question as well as to load the next question when available
* A romanji assist may be available for question, but will only be shown when the romanji option is selected
* There is an option to switch the Question and Answer display, so that the (typically) english answer will become the question. This can be a usefull study technique to assist with learning.
* A question counter is availble, currently it only shows when the option to remove questions is selected. As you progress questions will not repeat (unless it was written more than once), the counter will then tell you how many questions remain in the set


**Loading a PSV File**

If you have a PSV available to study, you will be able to select the browse button and you can then select your file. Hitting Load PSV will read your file and generate your flash cards. 

**WRITING A PSV**

A PSV replicates a data table (think excel or a similar spread sheet application).
To write a PSV, you create the data one row at a time with each row separated by a pipe "|". Each row is separated by a new-line (the same as hitting enter).

**Making a PSV File with Japanese Flash Card File Maker**

Included in the repo is a application to assist with making PSV files. The app allows you to enter multiple rows of data, where it can then convert the data into text that can be coppied into a manualy made PSV file or can be downloaded directly from the page itself with the correct formatting.

**DOWNLOAD AND RUN**

To Download and run the application, all you have to do is clone the repository and open up a JapaneseFlashCard instance in your favorite browser.

**CODEPEN DEPLOYMENTS**
