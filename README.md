**ABOUT**

The CSV Flash Card App takes in a Comma Separated Values (CSV) of  question and answer style notes.

For the time being, notes must be as questions then answer.

Once you have loaded a CSV, hitting the "Next Question" button will bring up a new questions. Hitting "Answer" will reveal the answer.

Questions will be presented randomly, with a non-random option being in the works.

**DOWNLOAD AND RUN**

To Download and run the application, all you have to do is clone the repository and open up the CSVFlashCard file in your favorite browser.

**WRITING A CSV**

A CSV replicates a data table (think excel or a similar spread sheet application).

To write a CSV, you create the data one row at a time with each row separated by a comma ",". Each row is separated by a new-line (the same as hitting enter).

an example of a CSV might look like:

City, State

Cleveland, Ohio

Denver, Colorado

Jackson, Mississippi

Oakland, California
