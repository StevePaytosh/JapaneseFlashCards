**ABOUT**

The Japanese Flash Card App takes in a Comma Separated Values (CSV) of  question and answer style notes.

For the time being, notes must be as questions then answer.

Once you have loaded a CSV, hitting the "Next" button will bring up a new questions. Hitting "Next" again will answer the question

Questions will be presented randomly, with a non-random option being in the works.

The Master/Trunk branch of this repo is called senpai, for obvious reasons.

**DOWNLOAD AND RUN**

To Download and run the application, all you have to do is clone the repository and open up the JapaneseFlashCard file in your favorite browser.

**WRITING A CSV**

A CSV replicates a data table (think excel or a similar spread sheet application).

To write a CSV, you create the data one row at a time with each row separated by a comma ",". Each row is separated by a new-line (the same as hitting enter).
